### `apply_filter`

`apply_filter` is a concept often used in software development, especially in the context of web development and content management systems. It is typically associated with filtering or modifying data. It allows you to apply a specific function or set of rules to a given input, which can be a data set, text, or any other kind of information. This function returns the filtered or modified output.

Example:

```python
# Applying a filter to a list of numbers to get only even numbers
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
filtered_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
# filtered_numbers will be [2, 4, 6]
```

### `add_filter`

`add_filter` is not a standard term in programming. However, it could refer to adding a filter or a set of filtering rules to a specific data processing pipeline or system. It's typically used in the context of frameworks or libraries that allow you to add filters to data before further processing.

Example:

```javascript
// Adding a filter to a data processing pipeline
const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const filterByValueGreaterThan30 = (item) => item > 30;

const filteredData = data.filter(filterByValueGreaterThan30);
// filteredData will be [40, 50]
```

### `do_action`

`do_action` is a concept used in event-driven programming or frameworks. It involves performing a specific action or set of actions in response to an event or trigger. For example, when a button is clicked on a web page, you might "do an action" such as showing a popup.

Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
// Doing an action when a button is clicked
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

function handleClick() {
  // Action to be performed when the button is clicked
  alert('Button clicked!');
}

button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

### `add_action`

`add_action` is commonly used in the context of WordPress and similar systems. It's a way to hook custom functions or code to specific events or actions within the system. This allows developers to extend the functionality of a WordPress site by attaching their own code to predefined hooks.

Example (WordPress):

```php
// Adding an action to display a message
function my_custom_function() {
    echo 'Hello, World!';
}

add_action('wp_footer', 'my_custom_function');
```
